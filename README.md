An Instagram Web Application Replica

A system where users can create posts. All posts must have an image attached to it (PNG or JPG only) and some text associated
with it. A system is developed where users can follow each other to see their posts. Eventually this will lead to a timeline where the posts of a user
and the posts of users they follow will be merged together. Users will also be permitted to comment on their own or other posts..
